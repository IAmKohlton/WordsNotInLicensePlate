# WordsNotInLicensePlate
Solution to the question posed by a simple car word game 

The goal of the car game is to look at the characters in a license plate and try to find a word that satisfies two conditions

1) all three characters must be in the word

2) the three characters appear in the word in the same order that they appear in the license plate

e.g a license plate with the characters "gob" would match with the word "global"

(This assumes the license plates where you live have three characters in them)

This small script finds all the letter combinations for which no word exists
